Developing R packages
================

As a modern statistician, one of the most fundamental contributions you can make is to create and distribute
software that implements the methods you develop. I have gone so far as to say if you write a paper without
software, [that paper doesn't exist](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/01/23/statisticians-and-computer-scientists-if-there-is-no-code-there-is-no-paper/).

The purposes of this guide are:

* To explain why writing software is a critical component of being a statistician.
* To give you an introduction into the process/timing of creating an R package.
* To help you figure out how to distribute/publicize your software.
* To remind you that ["the perfect is the enemy of the very good"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good).
* To try to make sure Leek group software has a consistent design.<sup>1</sup>


Why develop an R package?
--------------------

Cause you know, you do what your advisor says and stuff.

But there are some real reasons to write software as a statistician that I think are critically important:

1. You probably got into statistics to have an impaact. If you work with Jeff it was probably to have an impact 
on human health or statistics. Either way, one of the most direct and quantifiable ways to have an impact on the
world is to write software that other scientists, educators, and statisticians use. If you write a stats method paper
with no software the chance of impacting the world is dramatically reduced. 
2. Software is the new publication. I couldn't name one paper written by a graduate student (other than mine) in the
last 2-3 years. But I could tell you about tons of software packages written by students/postdocs (both mine and at
other places) that I use. It is the number one way to get your name out there in the statistics community. 
3. If you write a software package you need for yourself, you will save yourself tons of time in sourcing scripts,
and remembering where all your code/functions are.

(or ever really, remember the perfect is the enemy of the very good).
