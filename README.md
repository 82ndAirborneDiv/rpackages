Developing R packages
================

As a modern statistician, one of the most fundamental contributions you can make is to create and distribute
software that implements the methods you develop. I have gone so far as to say if you write a paper without
software, [that paper doesn't exist](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/01/23/statisticians-and-computer-scientists-if-there-is-no-code-there-is-no-paper/).

The purposes of this guide are:

* To explain why writing software is a critical component of being a statistician.
* To give you an introduction into the process/timing of creating an R package.
* To help you figure out how to distribute/publicize your software.
* To remind you that ["the perfect is the enemy of the very good"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good).
* To try to make sure Leek group software has a consistent design.[1][1]







[1]: These design requirements are subject to update and may not reflect Leek group software created before 9/18/2013 
(or ever really, remember the perfect is the enemy of the very good).
